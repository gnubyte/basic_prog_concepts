Basic Programming Concepts


## Purpose:
 To visualize the topics that I am trying to learn, and display to current and future employers that I can demonstrate these skills
 
 **This is a list based on my own experience in the field, and what I find to be useful skills in any programmer or even a scripter. I try to cultivate these skills in myself as well as anyone else I have to work with**
 
 **Meta Culture:**
 - [x] Revision history _using git_
 - [] Unit testing  _unittest_
 - [x] Markdown knowhow
 - [] Using a debugger properly _stack data, watches, breakpoints, stepthroughs_
 - [x] Understanding Statements
 - [x] Understanding Operations
 - [x] Understanding Methods
 - [x] Understanding Methods
 - [x] Presence in online Programming communities
 - [x] Keeps up to date **daily** if not bi-daily, with changes to the field
 - [x] Understands business needs vs. available resources vs. personal-wants
 - [x] Understands what constitutes a proper IDE
 - [x] Delineates development environment from deployment environment
 - [] Can use CI _continuous integration_ to deploy code rapidly (Docker?- Gitlab-Jenkins)
 - [x] Can deploy webhooks for their code to communicate to teammates in chosen automated environment
 - [] Can use configuration tools or cookbooks in environment (Chef, Ansible, Saltstack)
 - [] Has used API's for fullstack environment control (Openstack)
 - [x] Can work in an environment without requiring anything but the actual workstation itself (generates or uses open source tools or freeware to accomplish tasks, without incurring overhead costs outside that of labor)
 
 **Data:**
 - []  Create a data tree
 - [] display data in data tree
 - [] Manipulate the data tree
 - [] identify abstract types out of the data tree
 - [] Run means of operation of the abstract types individually
 - [] Understanding tuples: when, why, how
 - [] Understanding Dictionaries: when, why, how
 - [x] Understanding operations: when, why, how (*,/,%,+,-,++,--)
 - [x] Abstract Types: declaring variables
 - [x] Casting data types
 - [x] Comparison operators
 - [x] Can redirect stdrr, stdin, stderr in given language
 
 **Security: **
 - [] Understanding Hashes
 - [x] Understands TLS/SSL
 - [] Understands and employs proper use in applications built (PH: Yes- MySQL is an example)
 
 **End Product Handling:**
 - [x] Can compile code
 - [x] Can identify serial numbers or hardware specifics utilizing the OS features (WMI, IOKit, Init)
 - [x] Can log user & interaction properly
 - [x] Can log bugs and auto report using self-made tools or 3rd party tools (SentryIO)
